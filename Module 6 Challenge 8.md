# Module Name
Practicing Piping

## Challenge Name
You know how to redirect errors to a file, and you know how to pipe output to another program, such as grep. But what if you wanted to grep through errors directly?

The > operator redirects a given file descriptor to a file, and you've used 2> to redirect fd 2, which is standard error. The | operator redirects only standard output to another program, and there is no 2| form of the operator! It can only redirect standard output (file descriptor 1).

Luckily, where there's a shell, there's a way!

The shell has a >& operator, which redirects a file descriptor to another file descriptor. This means that we can have a two-step process to grep through errors: first, we redirect standard error to standard output (2>& 1) and then pipe the now-combined stderr and stdout as normal (|)!

Try it now! Like the last level, this level will overwhelm you with output, but this time on standard error. grep through it to find the flag!
### Solve
I used the pipe operator and >& operator to grep the error

```bash
command 1 /challenge/run 2>&1 | grep "pwn\.college"
pwn.college{APkWHWFq481NULuVDFUqys1t9iV.QX1ATO0wyN1AzNzEzW}
```
