## Challenge Name
You can scroll man pages with the arrow keys (and PgUp/PgDn) and search with /. After searching, you can hit n to go to the next result and N to go to the previous result. Instead of /, you can use ? to search backwards!

Find the option that will give you the flag by reading the challenge man page.

### Solve
**Flag:** 

I first searched the right file from the man challenge and then used it to print the flag.

```bash
command 1 man challenge
command 2 /challenge/challenge --sgk
pwn.college{MVirPSW0DGPFABOTajcZC29gw80.QX1EDO0wyN1AzNzEzW}
```
