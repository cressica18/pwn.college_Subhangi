# Module Name Hello Hackers

## Challenge Name
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.

You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!
### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`
I used the up and down keys to get the flag.
```bash
pwn.college{IeFc7yKxiQ0QO-d3MCDrZgnygU7.0lNzEzNxwyN1AzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
Learned hwo to get the previous commands which will be extremely helpful for the future
