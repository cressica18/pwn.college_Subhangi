# Module Name
Shell Variables

## Challenge Name
There are multiple ways to access variables in bash. echo was just one of them, and we'll now learn at least one more in this challenge.

Try the env command: it'll print out every exported variable set in your shell, and you can look through that output to find the FLAG variable!
### Solve
I used env to get the flag

```bash
command 1: env
pwn.college{4PN2JAI-mgDFb1nxssKSvoUwRCU.QX4UTN0wyN1AzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
